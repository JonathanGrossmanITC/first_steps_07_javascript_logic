# JavaScript Logic  

Welcome to the seventh lesson! In this lesson, you learn about JavaScript logic. Adding logic to your JavaScript code will give your webpage functionality. You can add logic to your code using loops, conditionals, operators, and expressions. First, you will learn about looping through arrays and strings. Next, you will learn about adding expressions to your code using conditionals and operators. Using these tools alone and in combination with one another will give your application the ability to change based on the circumstances.

At the end of this lesson, you see a live coding example. The live coding session reinforces what you learn in the lesson. This lesson also helps prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from the session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

- Hour 1: [Loops and Iterable Data Types](#loops-and-iterable-data-types)     
- Hour 2: [Conditionals, Operators, and Expressions](#conditionals-operators-and-expressions)   
- Hour 3: [Live Coding](#live-coding)  

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learned during the live session.   

## [Loops and Iterable Data Types](#loops-and-iterable-data-types)   

- A loop is a block of code that repeats itself  
- Typically has a [counter, condition, and iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code#keep_me_in_the_loop) in addition to whatever code is inside the loop  
- Loops are most useful when you want to run the same block of code on multiple values  
- Loops, therefore, are a great tool to use with [iterable data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterable_examples)  
- The iterable data types you should know of are strings and arrays  
- The types of loops for you to know about are `for` loops, `while` loops, and `for/in` loops    
- A `for` loop repeats a block of code **for** a pre-defined number of times
- A `while` loop repeats a block of code **while** a condition is true and therefore the number of times it runs is not necessarily pre-defined    
- A `for/in` loop is like a `for` loop but it's for looping through an object of key:value pairs, not for strings and arrays  
- Here is [an example](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) of how a `for` loop can transform your code  
- Walk through a `for` loop step-by-step explaining what happens and how the syntax works 
  -- Focus on using the index position to move through the array  
  -- Having a solid understanding of [index positions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#referring_to_array_elements) is critical   
  -- ES6 has [built-in methods for looping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#array_methods) that you should know  
- Here are [examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp) of how a `while` loop works with some explanation  
- Walk through a `for` loop step-by-step explaining what happens and how the syntax works  
- Here is [an example and description](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_forin.asp) of how a `for in` loop works  
- [MDN's in-depth discussion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) is a good resource to learn more advanced ways of working with loops, like using `break` and `continue`

The live coding session continues working on the live code from the previous lessons. Here are the tasks:
